       <P>"Hi, I'm a first-year Computer Science student who's been coding for about five months now. I'm really into it and want to join 'Open Code' to learn from seniors. I'm excited to improve my skills and be part of the team!"As a first year student in Computer Science branch I started coding just after My jee advanced exams. As I am from state board I didn't have real exposure to coding beforehand. But Now I am exploring and learning about coding.Till now I have done ...... . I am fascinated by  the learnings and the potential it holds for future. I have gone through Opencode club's GitHub profile and want to be part of the purpose of Learning and growing together. Also the projects you made looks fascinating. So I want to join this Club to learn from guidance of my seniors, to collaborate to do projects and after I get experience I want to  help others who are new to this coding journey but are eager to learn just like me now.</P>
